Abstract: Native advertising has surged in popularity due to its ability to engage consumers with minimal disruption to their online experience. However, this ad format raises important ethical concerns about its potential deception. In response to these concerns, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends clear ad disclosures to mitigate consumer confusion, yet the effectiveness of such disclosures alone remains a subject of ongoing debate. This study examines whether native ads, which closely resemble organic content, are more likely to deceive consumers, even when disclosure labels are present. It also explores how the interplay of text and visual elements within these ads influences perceived deception. Furthermore, the research investigates the role of privacy policies, specifically the use of third-party cookies in targeting advertising, in shaping consumer susceptibility to deceptive practices. Drawing on the Persuasion Knowledge Model as a theoretical framework, and employing advanced machine learning techniques to quantify textual and visual similarities between ads and editorial content, we assess how these resemblances impact consumers’ recognition of persuasive intent and subsequent behaviors. Our findings reveal that, even when native ads feature clear disclosure labels, ads with high relevance, particularly those with strong textual similarity to editorial content, lead to increased click-through rates but also result in higher bounce rates. This suggests that consumers may experience a delayed recognition of the ad’s commercial nature, which heightens their vulnerability to deception. The interplay between high relevance and resemblance not only amplifies this vulnerability but also diminishes the overall user experience. The results offer valuable insights for regulatory bodies, such as the FTC, providing specific recommendations on how advertising presentation can be adjusted to better inform consumers. The study also suggests that privacy policies, particularly those governing third-party cookies, should be considered in tandem to more effectively protect consumers from deceptive practices in the digital landscape.
