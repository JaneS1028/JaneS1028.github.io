Abstract: The introduction of new privacy regulations has prompted ongoing debate about whether strengthened protections impede innovation and economic activity, a concern partly supported by empirical studies documenting short-run declines in various performance metrics following regulatory enactment. However, the broader evidence base is more heterogeneous, with research also identifying beneficial outcomes and suggesting that regulatory effects may evolve as firms and markets adapt to new compliance environments. The prevailing empirical focus on short-term impacts—driven in part by identification challenges that intensify over longer horizons—risks obscuring potential longer-run adjustments in competition, innovation, and consumer welfare. Given the maturation of existing privacy frameworks and the emergence of new proposals such as the AI Act, reassessing these dynamics is both timely and policy-relevant. To address this gap, this study aims to replicate three influential empirical analyses of privacy regulation and extend their temporal scope, enabling a systematic evaluation of how the economic consequences identified in prior work unfold over extended periods as firms internalize, respond to, and ultimately innovate under regulatory constraints.
